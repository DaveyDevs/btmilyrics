          <span id="band-name">Bomb The Music Industry!</span> is usually
          described as a music collective and was started by Jeff Rosenstock
          around 2004. I feel like there's more I could say about them in
          person, but here's a few words -

          <br />
          <br />
          The story is that it started out with Jeff leaving a semi-successful
          band and just saying fuck it and creating an album all by himself at
          home and putting it up for free on the internet. It eventually evolved
          into a whole collaboration of friends (including Laura Stevenson, who
          you'll hear singing in some of these songs). So shows would go from
          huge whole bands with horns and everything to sometimes just Jeff
          playing and singing alone to tracks off of his ipod.

          <br />
          <br />
          They were almost at Fugazi levels of DIY but always stayed real goofy
          and would tell kids to bring blank shirts to shows so they could
          spraypaint their logo on them behind the venue. The songs are about
          being a poor traveling artist in NYC and beyond, the music scene,
          talkin shit, being real sad, drinking alot, and morreeeee. I'm not
          sure how well the lyrics aged, but they definitely said and did alot
          of stuff that was risky for being successful in the 2000's. They also
          started one of the first record labels that just put everything online
          and was donation based for digital downloads, years before streaming
          and all that blew up.

          <br />
          <br />
          It's hard to say why this band means so much to me. For one, the songs
          masterfully explore all the different genres and styles of punk rock,
          and plays with them and makes fun of them at the same time. I think
          alot of the lyrics helped me explore and discover my depressive
          tendencies as well, and I'll never forget how much that meant for
          exploring my brain and putting names on things. They're also just
          really funny, and kept things fun and exciting.

          <br />
