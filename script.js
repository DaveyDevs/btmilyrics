    lyrics: `When we're not feeling strong, we grab the mic and sing along...
            Na na na na, etc
            Whenever I go to a show it always feels like I've been time warped back to the eleventh grade
            The scene's uniting so the gangs can keep on fighting
            "Don't say the wrong thing or I'll see you in the parking lot."
            Brass knuckles are a great equalizer when you have no self-esteem
            If one guy is outnumbered, how are you the winning team?
            Don't get mad if you're hit in the "mosh pit." This is a friendly release
            I doubt that some fourteen-year-old is trying to disturb your peace
            When you bring your fist back to start the attack think about the kid
            You're much too old. He's all alone
            Walk away. Don't kick his fucking ass
            So if I kissed you on the nose or offered you a hug how could you possibly still wanna fight?
            We'll drink some beers (or if you're straight edge, we'll drink cola) and we'll talk about how much we both liked Scarface
            You'll back down because you're homophobic
            Gold medals go to the pacifists who won't fight you
            Sorry, dude, this is passive resistance
            Because we're all here for the same stupid reason, we all like some stupid band
            So let's sing loud, proud and clear in a language we both understand
            When you bring your fist back to start the attack
            Think about the reason you went to shows at twelve years old
            We all felt alone. It was NOT to kick my ass`,

    title: "It Ceases to Be “Whining” if You’re Still “Shitting Blood”",
    lyrics: `Sing the fucking songs you told the world to sing
            Sing it right unless you want to fail
            Listen back and punch the shit that we don't like
            You can't do it right in just one take
            
            Because you aren't good enough
            You were never good enough to sing your own songs oh so perfect
            
            If you fuck this up you fuck the record deal
            And respect of all our famous friends
            Drift too far and it is inaccessible
            Do it right, we worked as hard as you
            
            And we didn't come this far
            For you to fuck this up and then just fuck our whole damn lives
            
            So write some songs with lots of hooks
            Remember why you wrote songs in the first place
            Let's start a band
            This is all that you can do
            
            So write some songs with lots of hooks
            Remember why you wrote songs in the first place
            Let's start a band
            This is all that you can do
            
            So cut the cookie, five sharp points to make a star
            Cut the corners, get the biggest tours
            Traffic violations mean bad credit now
            Twenty triple zeroes in the hole
            
            And it wouldn't be so bad
            If we crashed the fucking van and watched our fucking debt go up in flames
            You know it wouldn't be so bad if we just threw up our hands
            Instead of feeding something I did not want to create
            Your underground is a mistake
            
            So write a song without a hook
            Remember why you wrote songs in the first place
            Not to start a band
            We've got nothing else to do
            
            Let's write a song without a hook
            Remember why you wrote songs in the first place
            Not for a man
            Who runs a fucking focus group
            
            So write a song without a hook

            Sixty degrees fahrenheit
            We can't see the stars tonight
            Cause apartments generate ambient light
            I'm sorry that we're not already drunk
            
            Hours later we're getting there
            Meters away from the shore
            My forty of Corona is just
            Drops away from being kicked
            And I don't know what I'm gonna be tomorrow
            
            When you stayed overnight making out with a stranger
            In the bottom of a boat that belonged to a stranger
            And you came home at six in the morning
            After being caught ass naked by the dude who threw the party
            I thought that we'd never grow up
            
            And now all my friends rise at eight
            They go to sleep before midnight
            And I just wanna drink 'til three
            Embarrassing myself publicly
            And you all used to be just like me
            You fuckers used to be just like me
            
            Now I sit and stew alone
            Everyone's already sleeping
            Everybody's moved away
            And can pay their bills on time
            No one else is making a hundred and ten bucks for twenty hours
            God I hate this fucking place
            God I hate what happened to me
            You promised we'd stay best of friends
            But we can't cause I can't grow up
            
            And it kills me. Yeah it kills me
            That I don't know what I can do
            Cause I can't breathe correctly and
            I can't sleep or anything and
            I can't think of anything
            I can't think of anything
            
            Now every night's miserable
            I'm so sad that I can't even get drunk
            So let's go out just one last time
            Let's finish off a box of wine
            Do shots of yukon jack and lime
            Can we drink 'til I fucking die?
            
            I'll make you party at my funeral
            Cause mourning is for suckers
            I'll rent a ferris wheel and
            Cotton candy machine and have open bar
            With all the Pabst that you can drink
            The PA blasting my Clash records
            You'll finally know life's okay
            Even when bad things happen
            
            So just one more beer, then grow up
            So just one more beer, then grow up
            So just one more beer
            Go to work
            Pay your bills
            Eat a dick

        Staten Island traffic in the summer, baby
        
        And when you stuff yourself into a suit and tie
        Do you think the judge can see through the sweat
        As he gives you your fine for a post-panic attack speeding ticket
        On a 90 degree day in New York
        And yeah, you're gonna drive home for three hours
        To work in a basement for tribute bands making posters
        To pay about a fifth of that price
        It's just Staten Island traffic in the summer. Oh!
        
        That orange ball
        That burning orb of fire in the sky is gonna explode and we're all gonna die!
        Except for the foolish few who will "think ahead"
        And drive their SUV's to their bomb shelters
        Complaining about no air conditioning
        Because "baby, we ain't got no more electricity."
        They wanna rise when it's done, be a leader with a gun
        Be a leader of what? Like a hundred and one?
        Well, fuck it, I'm gonna hang out on the rooftop when it comes
        
        Cause when it's dark, it'll be night time, baby
        And I'll get my ass on up out of this mess
        The only stores that are open, baby
        They gonna sell beer, and they're gonna sell ice cream
        And we'll drink drink drink and get drunk drunk drunk
        And we'll talk talk talk about how much fun we had, yeah, when
        We were fuckin' the world
        
        Through the glares on our windshields, we can't see each others eyes
        Just McDonalds cups and wrappers that they're throwing at full speed
        And yes, I long for a shadow. And yes, I always appreciate the irony
        That the only cool comfort that allows us to see is a goddamn billboard. Sing it with me
        
        A BILLBOARD IS THE ONLY THING PREVENTING US FROM BLINDLY CRASHING
        And we'll never see a city not marred by advertisements
        And we'll NEVER have a future not working for those companies
        And it's sure as shit not getting better so we might as well accept it now, oh
        
        And that really doesn't cheapen anything because, baby, we're all born to be businessmen
        Every Fugazi record has a catalog number and a price tag and every independent label is selling you another goddamn product
        But, NO, WE'RE not slaves to the music (no, no, no)
        Oh no, WE'RE not slaves to the company, baby (no, no, no)
        We do what we're born and raised to do and when you create something
        You're producing something and that act of producing is the creation of a product

        Yeah, we were fucking the world
        Yeah, we were fu (fu) cking (cking) the (the) world (world)

        When the comet hits, you ain't gonna have no bills to pay
        When the bomb hits, it's gonna be a four day weekend. Hey hey!
        When it's all done I'm gonna feel great finally
        
        And when I finally got to work today
        I ate my Subway sandwich
        And I drank my Coca-Cola Classic
        And then I ate my Sunchips
        And I thought about the weekend
        When I'd fill up my Ford van
        With Mobil brand gas
        And drive to the Clear Channel venue
        And I'd drink myself a Budweiser
        And play my Fender guitar
        Through my Fender amplifier
        And tell the kids with a straight face
        Through a Shure microphone
        And JBL speakers that corporate rock is for suckers

        Here's the thing about the music business
        You can't become an addict 'til you're fucking famous
        If you do it backwards it just means your rent will
        Be overdue and you'll have to keep a day job
        
        Get up, stand up, line up with the rest of them
        All so different, I say you're all the same
        Get up, stand up, line up with the rest of them
        S-A-F-E, you play it safe
        
        Here's the thing about the music business
        Ten thousand records isn't much if you consider the budget
        Your promo, your parties, payola
        Insures that your shitty band will stay poor
        
        Here's the thing about a nail in a coffin
        It keeps that shit shut while it's six feet under
        And zombies no one cares about don't get a chance to
        Rise from the dead and make a VH1 special
        
        And if I'm wrong I'll shut my mouth
        
        Get up, stand up, line up with the rest of them
        All so different, I say you're all the same
        Get up, stand up, line up with the rest of them
        S-A-F-E, you play it safe
        
        Get up, stand up, line up with the rest of them
        All so different, I say you're all the same
        Get up, stand up, line up with the rest of them
        Safe
        
        If it's playing what you're into even though it's not the current trend
        S-A-F-E, we play it safe
        If it's trying not to be boring to keep the audience interested
        S-A-F-E, we play it safe
        
        If it's making music that we like instead of what some label says
        S-A-F-E, we play it safe
        But if it's pulling this shit that you do every night...
        35 bucks a ticket to hear another ironic 80s pop song cover?
        Yeah I love your stacked chest six pack you fucking punk
        
        You're playing it safe, you're playing it safe
        You're playing it safe
        You play, you play
        You play, you play
        
        You're playing it safe, you're playing it safe
        You're playing it safe

        Where we can just dance until we're dead
        And it never really matters what they said
        So put a cork in the guy up front
        Don't let the world stop dancing
        
        The kids will just dance until they're dead
        It never really mattered what we said
        So we gotta just shut the fuck up
        Don't make the world stop dancing
        
        Step back, everything's alright
        We've all heard the facts but we're drunk tonight
        Ooh, looks like somebody read a book - wow!

        Cause when your ear's put down to the bottom of the street
        You can't dance, man, it's really hard to move your feet
        Shut up, shut up, don't think, shut up, shut up since it's not that bad
        No, it's not that bad, no
        
        Obviously something isn't right
        But if ignorance is bliss
        Well, would you rather smile or fight?
        Well, I'll take fight
        
        The kids just dance until they're dead
        It never really mattered what we said
        So we gotta just move on out
        And let the kids keep dancing
        
        So we gotta just move on out
        And let the kids keep dancing
        So we gotta just move on out

        I woke up on the floor of a famous Minneapolis rapper (whose name will go unmentioned.)
        I didn't crush the cat
        No one wrote "dick" on my forehead
        I wasn't seeing stars, I was seeing cigarettes and 1990's compact discs
        I didn't even feel depressed like every other day that I wake up
        
        I wouldn't trade it for the world, I would trade it for way less
        Just a parking spot and a place to call my home
        I'm always waking up hating that life ain't perfect
        Despite what they say, my mistakes AREN'T worth it
        But fuck it, I got through today
        I can get through tomorrow
        
        We lost a tire, but we put it back on
        I lost the love of my life, holy shit, I got a better one
        I lost a couple of my favorite shirts and favorite friends
        I lost my favorite band
        I feel like I have lost my mind and people tell me "this is fine."
        Still, I feel shitty every time I try to fucking fall asleep at night
        
        I wouldn't trade it for the world, I would trade it for way less
        Just a parking spot and a place to call my home
        I'm always making mistakes that are never worth it
        Despite what they say, I hate that life ain't perfect
        But fuck it, I got through today
        I got a few more tomorrows
        
        And everyday I wake and smile but by day's end my smile subsides
        But I guess I'll be here a while and I'll smile through today, 'cause last night I didn't die
        
        [Pt. IV. Cecil Otter Tattoo]
        
        And I know I'm not dead because I just threw up in my own mouth and swallowed back
        This hangover ain't that bad
        
        I feel worse just about every day, but James Brown must have sparked a change
        Somewhere in our dialogue about sleep, hardcore and not being young
        
        Got it drilled in my leg
        Because I fucked my head
        When I'm all alone, I will always have one friend
        
        When I wish I was dead
        And I hate my friends
        I must repeat this 'til the end
        I still have a home even if my home's a van

        Almost a hundred bucks worth of veggie burgers and buns
        
        I bought a case of beer and the charcoal to light
        Said that we should do this every single night
        Don't worry about the cash because I've got the scratch
        And I can't save my money because that isn't polite

        No parties last all night, just TV and websites
        And reproduction Peanuts strips I've read a million times

        Letting fresh Georgia air go to waste?
        It's really not funny how bad I am with money

        No matter where you move, no matter how cheap the rent
        Stop screaming for a change, start screaming for a wage
        
        And the irony of plastic is when it starts replacing cash
        Soon enough you have no cash and it gets replaced with debt
        And all you're left with is past mistakes and the envelopes change color
        All dimly lit pastels, they go white and then to yellow then to pink

        It's hard to pay the bills when you can't work a forty hour week
        It's hard to interview when I am too depressed to even speak

        I'll understand what is said when I'm out with my friends
        And at the end of the night
        Baby, I'm'a gon' drive 'em home
        
        And all the time that I waste repeating the mistakes
        And the ridiculous taste and the look on my face
        I'm gonna take it back
        Baby, I don't love you no more`,

        Let the day roll in, let the day roll out
        Let the robot transport me from Clayton to my house
        Let the shit roll in, let the shit roll out
        Because I'm goddamned bound to stick it out with my survival pals
        
        [Verse 1]
        Let the shit crash down
        Let the shit crash down
        Let the servers giggle, holler and ignore the sound
        And at 2 AM I'll be closing up alone
        
        [Chorus]
        Today I played my first show in, like, twenty-seven days
        Or got my ass kicked in, like, twenty-seven ways
        No matter which way it goes, at the end of the day I gotta change my clothes
        Maybe it's mundane when I explain it to you, but I just need something to do
        
        [Verse 2]
        Or else I'll just think about the shows I've played while forgetting all traces
        Of the people, the places, the music, the faces
        When we could talk in present tense without being complacent
        When we could be more honest without being fucking wasted
        
        Man, shit
        I let the shit roll in
        And at the 2 AM, I'll always be alone inside an empty home
        
        [Chorus]
        
        [Altered Chorus]
        Do you think I want to be this way?
        Do you think I want to be this way?
        Hey, don't you know that I've had better days
        But we've all had worse and we've all felt hurt so
        Maybe it's mundane when I explain to you
        But I just need something to do
        
        [Bridge]
        To get the past out of my head, to stop replaying shit I've said
        Put my head right down, scrub hard and I will get through this night
        Get the past out of my head, stop replaying shit I've said
        Put my head right down, scrub hard and I will get through this night
        
        Leave the pit, giving pizza to the homeless [and sleep]
        Show up late at the bar, the drunks are talking about politics [and go]
        I'm not really digging the idea of driving 18 hours at 8 AM [to sleep / step into the shower, the water cascades down my head just like dirt from a car wash on a six year old van]
        
        [Outro]
        And go to sleep

        The gates rise up like they belong in prison
        And my balance is low
        I better pick a good place, I got one ride to go
        
        Your fucking cocaine party fucking freaks me out
        When did Scott Weiland show up, how long's he sticking around?
        I guess this new fare hike means that I'll ride my bike
        Play video games and do other stuff that I like
        
        And in the morning, cleaning up, we found these plastic bags
        With a little bit of party left, and started to laugh
        Man, I'm glad I passed out from the booze and the weed
        'Cause the house was up till 6 AM doing speed
        
        Now it's 1 AM and I'm quite a few in
        I can barely make out where the bathroom line begins
        And it's been moving five inches every fucking five minutes
        I want to ask the overprivileged kids
        
        If they would fucking mind, I gotta take a piss in the cocaine room
        What is this, the line for lines, a long line for lines?
        I'm getting claustrophobia from the twenty-something set with bleary eyes
        What is this, the line for lines, a long line for lines?
        
        I, I, I, I don't wanna be part of this Friday night or Saturday night
        I, I, I, I don't wanna be part of this line for lines, long line for lines
        I, I, I, I don't wanna be part of this night
        
        When I go out these days, all I do is complain
        About the booming bass and the shitty DJ
        If I wanted to go to a dance club, I'd own a bottle of Brut
        A closet full of Christian Dior and I'd be in a different room
        
        'Cause we can dance to Otis Redding, P.O.S., and M.I.A
        And if you're on Serato Scratch, don't call yourself a DJ
        Beat detecting's got no attitude, your tempo maps can't fill a room
        But lemmings all have dancing shoes
        
        And I'm just freaking out, you're assaulting me with thrusts like I'm an asshole
        Sweating to the sounds of Billboard's Hot 100
        Like a total "yeah, bro!" dick, man, I thought that we all lived here 'cause we're different
        I guess I was wrong this time, time after time
        
        I, I, I, I don't wanna be part of this Friday night or Saturday night
        I, I, I, I don't wanna be part of these coke-y times and eight dollar wines
        I, I, I, I don't wanna be part of this night
        
        The city subway stations never glisten
        The gates rise up like "What's up? You're in prison!"
        Confined by alcoholism
        And lack of better decisions for having fun on the weekends
        
        But this shitty atmosphere keeps bumming me out
        Don't want my Club MTV, I hate Downtown Julie Brown
        I guess these new prices hikes will make me grab me light
        Climb the fire escape to the roof with a book that I like`,

        There's a light shining out from the windowsill
        Not content to project all day long
        Maybe I could walk a little to the library... closed
        Maybe I could do this right for once, get my ducks in a row
        
        And just stop talking trash or whatever they say
        Make the bed, sweep the floor, shake the carpet and spray
        Put my shit in a pile, on the top slap a post-it
        Don't worry, someday your skill set will be wanted
        
        But today everybody is a little tired
        It's Wednesday

        To Broadway
        
        And it's you and me and a tall boy of Colt 45 or Bud Light
        What's the cheapest one?

        Receipts and cards tumble out of my pocket to the floor of the station, I still don't have a wallet
        Up a flight of stairs to Herald Square, the umbrellas of New York take up too much air
        So we just walk real slow at double-arms-length, in unison
        
        My mom dragged me to the doctor today, I've had a cough for a month and it won't go away
        I've been sleeping on floors for three hours a day and I've got no insurance so she has to pay
        I can't talk to my friends because I'm embarrassed
        That I keep sliding back down, I keep getting depressed
        
        We got our ideals, but no way to achieve them
        We got our degree but got no means to use it
        We're swimming in debt with no way to surmount it
        
        We got thirty bucks and we spend it on whiskey
        We got credit cards so we got a new TV
        We got mobile phones but no minutes, so text me
        
        Get out of my way because I'm 25
        And I still act like I'm 10
        I'm 25 and I don't learn from my mistakes
        So I make them again and again and again and again and again
        
        We swallow our pride over piles of problems
        We whine and complain but we don't try to solve them
        We're reaching for answers but nobody's got them
        
        Get out of my way because I'm 25

        I guess I’m saying we could stand to be nicer
        
        Because when you’re in a basement talking shit and interspersing it with speaking in name drops and units
        I must admit I’m not the best when on the defensive, I’d rather steal your whiskey than your heart in conversation
        I’d rather break three strings a song than stick to a routine like I’m ripe for the picking after growing on a tree
        And then talk about the industry, cross-market positivity with vinyl nerds and brightly colored, quirky messy record sleeves
        
        I’d rather be vomiting and I despise vomiting
        Blugh
        
        But thanks for the beer. I appreciate your time but can we talk about something else?
        If you really think that you and I are on the same page, you can go ahead and fuck yourself

        Like God speaks through my acoustic guitar and I’ve got the perfect set of morals
        On a dry erase board at the front of the house
        Follow these conditions or we'll kick your ass out
        
        Vegans only, no meat allowed
        Straight edge only, no drinking allowed
        Fixed gears only, no three-speeds allowed

        ‘Cause you still beg for cash cause you spent your parents’ last on a Greyhound to the Fest
        And your jacket says Crass but I don’t give an ass, I’m not giving you fifty cents
        So that you can buy a forty and destroy a hotel party
        And the man who cleans your mess up shrugs and says
        
        This non-conformity looks like conformity
        Like boring, nice people pose threats to your authority
        This positivity is negativity
        And you boys sure left me with a mess to clean
        
        Smile big, hug bigger, talk big, act bigger
        Stop judging, do something, shut the fuck up, do something
        Instead of sneering at somebody because they're not stealing
        Buy a troubled friend a drink at the bar and tip well
        
        Don’t spend your time scoffing when you do that you’re just scoffing
        Like the people who scoff at us while defending our community
        You’re a teacher, you’re a parent, you’re the head of a dictatorship
        When the ground is covered up in rules you’re guaranteed to power trip
        
        This non-conformity looks like conformity
        Why should anyone believe in our community?
        This organization doesn’t feel like anarchy
        ‘Cause we’re suiting up to have the same identity
        
        And the boring, nice people say shut up the punx, shut up the punx!
        All the people who have barbecues to feed their friends and family
        Shut up the punx, shut up the punx!
        All the people writing zines with information, not just blaming things

        In a trashed room in 1996
        A fourteen year old punk and in a flash I'm my parents
        And we'll never know love, 'cause I was too busy talking to my Green Day posters
        They never said nothing to me
        
        Let's start a conversation about anything
        I'm tired of arguing
        It isn't fun for me
        Reverse psychology instead of just listening up - that always seemed stupid to me
        
        Can you stay here?
        Can we blast the Descendents?
        Can we turn our phones off and get lost in The Simpsons?
        I feel inches away from getting swallowed by darkness
        And I know that you're tired, but can you draw back the curtains for me?
        
        My friends ain't all that great
        We play in legion halls, slam beers outside, relieve ourselves on walls
        
        My friends ain't all that bad
        We play all ages shows and we'll start on time if you decide to go`,

    lyrics: `First off, I didn't feel comfortable
        I'd been sleeping for weeks and forgetting to eat
        And sleeping shitty in a college common room
        
        Trying to make friends with strangers, swapping telephone numbers
        Making crazy demands to play a show in your basement
        Two days later I didn't think that you would give us our first punk rock show, Chicago punk rock show
        
        As we get older every day feels longer
        And although I know I'll struggle I will
        Do my best to never get tired
        I know Chicago will be cold tomorrow
        Let's cash in on our thin blood and have another one
        
        I didn't think I had a chance
        I had a hunch that lost a lot of my friends
        I never thought I'd get the feeling back again
        I never thought I'd smile again
        'cause I felt kinda good in your neighborhood
        Although I kinda fell down atop a pile of kinda dried up blood
        And stumbled back to your home without outblacking
        
        As we get older every day feels longer
        And although I know I'll struggle I will
        Do my best to never get tired
        I know Chicago will be cold tomorrow
        Let's cash in on our thin blood and have another one
        No flaking no leaving
        
        No flaking no leaving, mistaking our dealings
        For burdens that stop us from waking up early
        And working, repeating the process of bleeding
        Our tired heads dry with the motions of failing again
        
        These days, we're both getting old
        And while you're buying a house, I'm losing sight of my goals
        I took my time and now I've got nothing to show
        But when I see you next year, we'll have a coffee or beer
        And I'll be real glad my failures aren't making things weird
        
        As we get older every day feels longer
        And although I know I'll struggle I will
        Do my best to never get tired
        I know Chicago will be cold tomorrow
        Let's cash in on our thin blood and have another one
        
        No flaking no leaving

        Our tired heads dry with the motions of failing again
        
        I'm tired of complaining
        I'm tired of complaining
        I'm tired of complaining
        I'm tired of complaining
        But I'm thankful for the first time I met Sanawon`,

    title: "Campaign for a Better Next Weekend",
    lyrics: `[Verse 1]
        Woke up about 10 am, it's 65 degrees
        Even though it's barely March since all winter it's been freezing
        This is cause for celebration, cause for picnics and coffee
        So I opened up my savings and grabbed a couple twenties
        And it felt just like a day away from home
        
        [Verse 2]
        Walked over to Nelson's where my bike was getting fixed
        Total damage: 34 bucks. I said, "Keep the extra six."
        I'm doing well today, I came home last week with enough to live
        I rode south to grab a package
        'Cause our postman never rings the bell
        He only leaves a slip and sometimes he doesn't even leave a slip
        He's such a dick
        Waiting in line for thirty minutes and I finally get my box
        Hold the door, they don't say thanks. I fumble with the lock
        And my bike hasn't rode this well since the day I picked it up
        A Ford Explorer jumps the light and I can't really stop
        And it feels like an alarm clock
        I tuck and roll like in the movies
        And slide across the concrete
        Everybody's all, "Oh shit!"
        And blood is dripping down to my feet
        But I get up and keep moving, it's a busy city street
        Keep on moving, busy street
        Ride the seven blocks to Boerum, carry my bike up two floors
        Situate the crowded hallway, limp and waddle through my door
        Throw the package onto my bed, start investigating sores
        The cuts are bigger than expected
        I guess I shouldn't have worn shorts
        
        [Verse 3]
        I thought about the winter
        Under layers, I wouldn't bleed
        Drinking root beer, watching football
        Oh, I never thought I'd be
        In that place everyone went to
        But it really just took me
        A couple extra years to get there
        Though at least I did feel free
        For the most part of your weekend
        Save the rubbing alcohol sting
        Oh, it felt just like vacation 'til I slaughtered my body
        And it's kind of fucked in Florida, skies are grey instead of blue
        I can't shrug off the awesome weather
        But I can surely dress my wounds
        
        [Outro]
        It felt just like a vacation but
        Still, we complained until
        We all felt jaded and
        Started to hate it`,

        But they get away with everything
        So I thought I could get away, I thought I could get away too
        
        Down in the gulf there's a black sea-monster
        And my crime ain't huge, a world-tattered cube
        That I didn't affix with a shiny new sticker
        Go swallow the summer and choke on the fumes
        Because they get away with everything that they do
        
        So hold onto your home
        It's shaky, I know, but if you flee trash will follow
        Home, onto your home
        It's shaky, I know, but if you flee trash will follow
        
        The winds that you left in your wake and you'll fall down again
        
        Oh, the office called. You're in deep, deep trouble
        The shit you're afraid of has made you hateful
        And you're letting on, tired eyes, all spiteful
        And nobody cares. We all got sorrows
        
        So hold onto your home and onto your hope
        Sorrow don't answer problems
        Hold onto your home and onto your hope
        Sorrow don't answer problems
        Hold onto your home and onto your hope
        Sorrow don't answer problems
        Hold onto your home and onto your hope
        Sorrow don't answer problems
        
        Nobody cares. We're all in trouble
        The shit that you hate don't make you special
        Nobody cares. We're all in trouble
        The shit that you hate don't make you special
        Nobody cares. We're all in trouble

        Took the train today, Rockaway for the hurricane waves
        I got sick yesterday, but it'll take much more to keep me away
        I know that today could be the end of summer and hey
        I've been procrastinating anyway, so what's one more day?
        So what's one more day?

        I can be sick tomorrow, I can work and I​ can catch up
        I can wait 'til tomorrow to pay my rent and start to grow up
        
        [Verse 2]
        All the headlines say "Surf's Up for the Hurricane Waves!"
        But the bodies say "it's gonna be a weekend filled with pain."
        I know usually I can find a cloud to cover anything
        Even on the clearest days but uncharacteristically
        I will retain some optimism

        Cuddle up in the storm
        Cheap Girls records

        I can wait I can wait 'til tomorrow

        There's only so many days you can spend waiting for the turn
        You're gonna get bored
        There's only so many days you can spend waiting until you don't love anything anymore

        You get yourself a bottle and say, "I don't do anything anymore."
        You get yourself a bottle and say, "I don't love anything anymore."
        You get yourself a bottle and say, "I don't do anything anymore."
        You get yourself a bottle and say, "I don't love anything anymore."
        You get yourself a bottle and say, "I don't do anything anymore."
        You get yourself a bottle and say!

        I know it's hella early but I don't give a fuck
        When it's eighty degrees and you're at the beach, you gotta sway with the breeze
        
        And on the 8 AM flight home there's a girl about my age
        Highlighting psalms in her bible in the seat that's next to me
        And I wonder when she comes home is it to a family?
        And if she needed a breather but just ended up lonely
        
        'cause everyone who loves you isn't always gonna be around to have your back but
        Being kind of lonely for a second here or there is really really so much better than someone always poking you
        They love you but they're always breathing down your neck. But
        Every now and then somebody calls you up and says "I'm coming back!"
        
        So I won't wake you when you're sleeping
        I won't call you when I'm freaking
        Out again if you are busy
        I won't take it personally
        
        Even nerves of steel deserve a breather
        Weight wears down the infrastructure
        And hearts of gold can still feel lonely
        If they don't know they're not the only ones
        
        They love you but they're always breathing down your neck. But
        Every now and then somebody calls you up and says "I'm coming back!"
        
        And Everybody that loves you will be leaving some day soon
        They've got problems to undo. They've got paperwork to do
        When I show up at 6 AM I hope somebody lets me in
        I know I've been gone a long time, but you know I'm still your friend
        
        And I hope you get the job that you've been looking for
        You are a decent girl and you don't need this anymore
        And yeah, I get that, for sure
        
        And I hope that when I sit around watching snow collect in banks on the ground
        That I don't get too down because you're not around`,

        The lazy tide is bringing me to shore
        Eighty degree water, I see right to the bottom
        Take the pressure off for good. Don't give me anymore
        
        Give me the worst sleep spots, corners to get stuck in
        Pump me full of friends and alcohol
        And I'll be thinking of you long after the night's through
        Long after I'm peeled off of the wall and shipped to Brooklyn
        
        And it might be cause I'm not alone
        But this vacation feels more like home
        Than habitually checking my phone for texts
        I won't respond to from people I don't talk to
        
        In truth, December destroyed me. January crushed me
        By February, I was not myself
        March rolled in like beatings and rolled out like a bear hug
        In April I stared out the window for a fucking month
        
        I don't want October. I don't want November
        I don't want to feel those crippling blows
        That I can't explain to myself, my friends or you
        So I soften them with hours of Nintendo
        
        And it might be cause I'm not alone
        But this vacation feels more like home
        Than refreshing e-mails I won't respond to
        From people I don't talk to
        
        Please give me Caye Caulker, my feet in the water
        Someone who doesn't yawn when I go on
        And I'll be thinking of her long after the summer
        Long after the crowd is bored and talking shit and moved away and everybody's gone
